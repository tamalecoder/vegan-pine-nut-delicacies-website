            <h2>Cozy and elegant plant-based recipes to share the holiday spirit</h2>
            <p>As the holiday season approaches, there’s nothing quite like the warmth of vegan pine nut delicacies to make gatherings feel special. 
Whether you’re hosting a family gathering or a festive party, your holiday table can showcase your elegant and thoughtful presentation, offering the surprises of conscious cuisine. 
Embrace the season with desserts that are as beautiful as they are flavorful, a true celebration of plant-based indulgence. 

Using plant-based ingredients like nut-based butters, natural sweeteners, and local flours ensures your holiday creations are both ethical and delicious. Each recipe is an opportunity to celebrate mindful cooking and the artistry of plant-based baking, while creating memories around a beautifully set table. 

<br> <br> During this season, think of treats that pair perfectly with tea, coffee, or hot chocolate, and brings a touch of Italian-inspired elegance to any holiday gathering. Toasted pine nuts add a delicate crunch to cookies, brownies, and festive tarts, creating layers of flavor that delight the senses. You could experiment with vegan pine nut tarts, featuring seasonal fruits like figs or pears for a refined twist. Or a tray of golden pine nut cookies, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  

Here are two treats delightful and rich for the chilly holiday season, two loved recipes from Italy I love to bake for company. </p>

<h3>Pine nut biscotti</h3> <p>
There are so variations you can make with biscotti. You can add rosemary, dried fruits, or even a touch of lemon. Because of their crispness, achieved through the classic double bake, they're ideal for dunking in espresso coffee or herbal tea. 

My favourite thing to do is lightly toast the pine nuts before incorporating them into the batter. I find this intensifies their flavour in such a lovely way. That said, it's completely optional, the double bake will naturally coax out their nuttiness too. If you decide to toast them, I suggest using a dry skillet over low heat as they burn quickly. 
Before the first bake, I like to press a few extra pine nuts on top of the loaf, just enough to create a simple, beautiful garnish once they turn golden in the oven.

Over time, I have found that you can give the recipe a vegan makeover by preparing the flax egg, using non-dairy milk, and vegan butter (or coconut oil). 

<br> <br> Biscotti are baked twice. First as a loaf, then sliced and baked again to dry. They are crisp and enduring, ideal for dunking. 
When I take that first bite, I always notice the subtle lemon brightness, the dry snap that softens into a mellow chew, and the buttery richness of the pine nuts that lingers long after. Dip one into your drink, take a quiet pause, and listen to the silence for a moment. There’s something meditative about it. 

After I finish this creation, I store the biscotti in an airtight container to keep them crisp and ready. Pine nuts have a short life as well so don't forget to check that the pine nuts are fresh since they can go rancid. 

If you’d like to see how another vegan lover does their beautifully refined take on the classic biscotti, you can look at this recipe: <a href="https://www.theplantbaseddad.com/vegan-biscotti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vegan Biscotti by The Plant Based Dad.</a>

<h3>Torta della nonna</h3>
Torta della Nonna, or “Grandmother’s Cake,” is one of those timeless Italian desserts that always feels like home. Originating in Tuscany, it’s built from a sweet short-crust pastry shell (pasta frolla), filled with smooth pastry cream (crema pasticcera), and topped with pine nuts and a dusting of powdered sugar. It’s simple, loved, and always somehow tastes like care.

The pine nuts are not just decoration. They complete the experience. They give a gentle crunch against the soft filling, a toasted aroma that fills the kitchen, and a touch of visual beauty that feels both rustic and refined. I never toast them beforehand; I scatter them generously over the top before baking, and let the oven do its quiet work. The pine nuts emerge golden, fragrant, and perfectly set into the pastry.

<br><br>The crema pasticerra I make isn't traditional. It's based on my own blend of nuts, with nutritional yeast, and coconut cream in place of eggs and dairy.
I love to use a 70% cashew, 30% pine nut blend for my crema pasticerra as it creates a lovely echo between the pine crust on top and the creamy interior, but it is totally normal to just do a purely cashew blend. I just can’t resist maximizing the pine-nut note whenever I can. 

For the pasta frolla, I use vegan butter. In place of milk and eggs, I use a blended mixture of coconut cream and coconut milk, almond milk, and cornstarch to thicken it up. The result is tender and fragrant, with just the right balance of crumb and hold. 

<br> <br>Since it's milk free, I can serve it to friends who are lactose-intolerant, and no one ever misses the milk. I bake the pie the day before I plan to serve it, as the cream sets beautifully overnight in the fridge. You can make the custard two days ahead to save yourself some time. Then fill in the pasta frolla, and topping it with nuts the day before. I store the pastry for no more than four days in the coolest part of my fridge. When I have tried freezing it, it tended to lose that tender creaminess that makes it special. 
Both of these recipes remind me why I love baking with pine nuts.
<br><br>
There’s a moment, after baking, when the kitchen smells faintly of toasted nuts mingling with vanilla, citrus, and pastry, and the air feels quiet. I take a small pause, to feel the satisfaction of a simple thing done well. Maybe that’s what Constantly Pining for More really means: not wanting excess, but wanting to keep finding that moment again.

I was inspired by this beautifully adapted vegan version of the classic <a href="https://carlocao.com/vegan-italian-custard-tart-torta-della-nonna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vegan Custard Pie (Torta della Nonna) by Carlo Cao.</a> I used it as a starting point and adapted my own flavour touches into it, I encourage you to do the same.
