    <h2>Pine mouth: A lingering metallic taste | My review of a McGill article</h2>
      <p>A food phenomenon I have warned readers about on my website recently resurfaced in an article from McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, which explored the condition informally known as “pine mouth”. Many people who experience pine mouth may not be aware of what is causing their sudden taste alterations. Only later do they discover the connection to pine nuts, usually through articles on the internet. One of the most interesting takeaways is that pine mouth is both real and bizarrely delayed, much to the confusion of its unfortunate victims. The symptoms typically begin one to three days after consumption and can last several weeks. People also report accompanying symptoms such as headaches, nausea, or stomach pain.</p>
<p>The article explains that taste disturbance is most likely linked to certain imported pine nuts, particularly those from specific Pinus species such as Chinese white pine (Pinus armandii). But don’t worry. Importers cut back on this variety, resulting in a sharp decline in pine mouth reports. In any case, the symptoms resolve naturally, though the experience can definitely be unsettling. I have known several people in my life who have told me they refuse to eat pine nuts, as they experienced loss of appetite and could not enjoy food with the metallic taste in their mouth. I feel sympathetic toward that because taste affects our enjoyment of food, comfort, memory, and experiences.
</p>

   <p> The scientific perspective is necessary and validating because, in this case, a temporary taste disorder could have easily been misattributed to allergies or food spoilage. But now we know that pine mouth behaves more like a neurological alteration called “dysgeusia”, which is responsible for the taste disturbance.</p>
<p>One quote from the article assures there is no reason to worry about harmful contamination:</p>
</p>
<p>“As stated in the paper, an analysis of the nuts did not reveal any mould or pesticide contamination. The only common feature was that in all cases the pine nuts had come from China.” </p>
<p>There is no regulation of the pine nut market, so it is both a misfortune that the Chinese white pine variety caused symptoms for consumers, and a relief that it was thankfully taken off the market. It is unfortunate that this pine nut caused so much distress and confusion for consumers, but I believe that sharing experiences like these matters, because awareness protects consumers in ways policy often does not.

        <h2>My favourite picnic spot</h2>
        <p>My favourite picnic spot is found in the Mill Creek Ravine in Edmonton. I love heading to one of the secluded spaces close to the North Saskatchewan River. I love how wonderfully quiet it feels, where the trees surround every view. It feels like stepping into a cozy little world. To get there, start where Saskatchewan Drive and Scona Road meet, follow down 92 Avenue and continue straight along the trail until you reach the first opening into a grassy field.
